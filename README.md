# Auto-suggest
This is an Auto-suggest application coded in JAVA using Netbeans IDE.Whenever a word is typed in the input text-field,a list of words are suggested to the user.This application uses trie data-structure for storing and printing the words.This auto-suggest application is widely uses in many Parsers,Text-editors,Search-engines......etc.

For demonstration purpose,I have used a text file which contains all the countries in the world.
